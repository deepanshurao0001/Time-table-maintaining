# Time-table-maintaining

This project is designed in such a way that it helps the user to search his own time-table from the complete timetable consisting data of all the users. 


The HTML code provided uses the following tags: 
<!DOCTYPE html>: declares the document type and version of HTML being used. <html>: defines the root element of an HTML document. 
<head>: contains meta information about the HTML document, including the page title and external CSS file. 
<title>: sets the title of the HTML document that appears in the browser tab or window. <link>: specifies the external CSS file to be used to style the HTML document. <body>: contains the visible content of the HTML document. 
<div>: defines a container for other HTML elements and is used to group them together. <h1>: defines a heading in the HTML document and indicates that it is the largest and most important heading. 
<datalist>: creates a dropdown list of predefined options for an input field. <option>: defines an option in a dropdown list for the <datalist> element. 
<label>: defines a label for an input element and is used to describe the purpose of the input. <input>: creates an input field for the user to enter data or make selections. 
<button>: creates a clickable button on the page. 
<script>: used to define a client-side script in the HTML document, although it is not used in the provided code. 
CSS 
Here are all the HTML tags used in the code: 
<div> - used with class="container" and class="search-container" 
<h1> - used for the main heading <label> - used for the search input label 
<input> - used with type="text" for the search input field 
<button> - used for the search button <table> - used for displaying the search results <th> - used for the table header <td> - used for the table data 
<tr> - used for the table rows with class="trClass"
<td> - used for the table cells with class="tdClass" 
JS 
The code snippet uses the following JavaScript tags: 
var: Declares a variable. 
XMLHttpRequest(): Creates a new XMLHttpRequest object. 
xhr.open('GET', excelUrl, true);: Opens the connection to the server to load the Excel file using the GET method. 
xhr.responseType = 'arraybuffer';: Sets the response type of the request to an ArrayBuffer. xhr.onload = function(e) {...}: Defines the callback function to be executed when the request completes. 
xhr.send();: Sends the request to the server. 
XLSX.read(data, {type: 'array'}): Reads the data from the Excel file and returns a workbook object.

CONCLUSION: 
In conclusion, the development of this timetable scheduling code will undoubtedly benefit educational institutions in terms of efficient and effective scheduling of their classes. The code makes use of advanced algorithms to ensure optimal scheduling of classes and to minimize conflicts and overlapping of schedules. 
Additionally, the code has the potential to be further improved and expanded by incorporating additional features such as integration with attendance management systems and room booking systems. This would allow for even greater optimization and efficiency in the management of academic resources. Overall, this project has demonstrated the benefits of using technology and algorithms to automate and streamline complex processes such as class scheduling. It has the potential to save time and resources, reduce errors and conflicts, and ultimately improve the quality of education provided by institutions.
